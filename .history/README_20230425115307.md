# APM - Application Performance Management

This is a mocking APM (Application Performance Monitoring) implemented into two projects: 

1) API Service for serving data to frontend;
2) Frontend for displaying data pulled from API Service;

The main goal of this project is to show how to implement a completed isolated frontend and backend project with a mocking APM. The frontend UI is a Responsive Single Page Application (SPA) implemented purely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The backend API Service is implemented with Node and Nest.js. Monitoring data is collected and saved to a Redis Database and asyncronous saved to a MongoDB database for API serving. A Nginx server is used to serve the frontend and backend services as a reverse proxy.
