# APM - Application Performance Management

This is a mocking APM (Application Performance Monitoring) implemented into two projects: 

1) API Service for serving data to frontend;
2) Frontend for displaying data pulled from API Service;

The main goal of this project is to show how to implement a complete isolated frontend and backend services. The frontend UI is a Responsive Single Page Application (SPA) implemented purely with HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. The backend API Service is implemented with Node and Nest.js. Monitoring data is collected and saved to a Redis Database and asyncronously saved to a MongoDB database for API serving. A Nginx server is used to serve the frontend and backend services as a reverse proxy for ochestration and load balancing.

The frontend UI is very light and loads fast on the browser. This is good for mobile users as sometimes they have a slow internet connection. As the frontend is a SPA (Single ), the user experience is very good as the user does not need to wait for the page to reload when navigating between pages.
